# Fruit Checklist

- [X] Bananas
- [X] Limes
- [X] Oranges
- [X] Papaya
- [X] Pineapple 

## Bananas

Captain of Fish Store has Bananas. He wants cannonballs for them. Guy at the start has cannonballs to give you.

## Limes

Ghost has limes. You get what it wants from the treasure chest. The skull gives you the key to open the chest.
Ghost does not currently add Limes to inventory.

## Pineapples

(Make joke about Ananas) 
Ended up making a joke about Pine and apples. Box on the beach has them. Need a crowbar or something to open it. ...Canon?

Talk to catcus, give it bottle of water, get sand dollar, give dollar to sword, get pineapple
You find empty bottle in ocean
You fill it at the pool (fresh water lake)

## Oranges

The boat with the second slightly smaller boat has a note talking about slightly smaller palm trees having oranges, and coming back after getting lost. The tiniest palm tree/shrub in the lake on the bottom of the map has it. 

If the player comes back after the skull tells them to get Lost, it'll say this more directly.

## Papaya

Pirate in the top left goes on a solliloque, arguably, about papayas. The player gets the idea that whatever these papayas are, that Ghoti might like them. Pirate doesn't seem like he's changing spots any time soon, so its on the player to hunt them down.

Scene 24 has buried treasure that'll appear after this. Talking to the pirate again will reveal this factoid. The X marks the key to the pirate's cabin.
